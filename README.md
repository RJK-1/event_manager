This code was mostly produced by following along with The Odin Project tutorial,
which is based and adapted from The Turing School's and Jump Start Labs project.

The time / day / count frequency methods were added through my work as part
of the assignments at the end of the tutorial, which has exposed me further 
to working with dates and times.
